# TMDB App
## Preface
I have not been able to complete all the features’ implementation. As I didn’t have any prior knowledge of working with Android or Kotlin, it took me a bit longer than usual to implement very simple and trivial things. 
Implementation of ‘Paging’ took most of the time and I learnt about Retrofit, RxJava while implementing it.
I believe that given 1-2 days more, I can complete the whole project.

## Features
Completed Features:
1.	Fetch the popular movie list from the given API and display it in a GridView.
2.	Endless Scroll using paging library.
3.	It should show the cover photo of the movie.
4.	It should show the poster of the movie.
5.	It should show the title of the movie.
6.	It should show the summary of the movie.
7.	It should show the rating of the movie.
8.	It should show the release date of the movie.
9. It should show the cast of the movie.

Incomplete Features:
1.	Users can save a movie from details of the movie. It will be saved on the device's local database.
2.	Users can view the list of saved movies
3.	Profile page should be a static page.

## How To Run It
Open the project in IntellIJ and build it. Connect it with a real device using USB cable and it will run.
